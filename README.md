## Assignment
Breakout was a hit game originally coded up by Steve Wozniak before he and Jobs started Apple. It's a simple game that is similar to Pong where you use a ball and paddle to break down a wall.<br>
You can try out the gameplay here: https://elgoog.im/breakout/ <br>
Try to avoid going to a tutorial on how to build breakout, instead spec out the project, figure out how it's going to work. Write down a checklist of todos and draw out a flow chart (if it helps).
